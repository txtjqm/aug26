to prepare: install git for windows and then after that install tortoisegit.

The project folder. food is your project folder with source code.
It may or may not look like this, with backups.
myproject
    |-- food
    |-- food-copy
    |-- food-copy2

1. in myproject folder, do rightclick->git create repository here
it makes a .git folder. This is used to store git stuff and is not useful
to look at. So far nothing has been added to git.
2. in food folder (where the project is) rightClick->tortoisegit->add
Then choose files to add. It shows all files checked, so leave it alone
and click commit.
It then shows the commit dialog; it shows you the files to be committed and wants
you to put in a message (something describing what you've done or need to fix).
I usually put in just a 1 or 2 etc. It wont commit without a message.
After commit, it offers to push the new versions to github. If you dont have
github setup or dont want to send files there, just click close.
For now, we are only using git locally, not on the github website.

Git is now setup, now see how its useful.
* edit some file and save it.
you will see a red dot next to the file, meaning that git has a different
version of it. 
* Look at the difference: rightclick the file->tortoisegit->diff with previous version.
it shows you the differences.
* now change more than 1 file. Without highlighting a file, righclick in the
folder, ->tortoisegit->diff with previous version. It will show you all files which you
changed, and if you click on any file, it shows you the difference.
* once you have all files the way you want, and you want to send them it git,
rightclick in the folder, "Git commit->master" and it shows you all changed files,
and wants you to add a commit message like a few steps ago. The next dialog is the
same as before, you can click close or push to your github account; just click
close for now.
