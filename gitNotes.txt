How to install git and tortoisegit.
Git is useful for keeping track of projects with many files and makes
it easy to compare what you have to what you had yesterday, last week etc.
It's also used for collaborating with others (that's the github version).
It's not for backing up projects for safety, use a thumb drive instead.

to prepare: 
install git for windows and then after that install tortoisegit. Tortoisegit
wont work without git.. you run tortoisegit from the file explorer, not as
a separate program. 

To setup a new git:
The project folder. For example food is your project folder with source code.
It may or may not look like this, with backups.
myproject
    |-- food
    |-- food-copy
    |-- food-copy2
(Note: food-copy ie copy2 etc wont get added to git. Since git cant always be trusted,
its important to still make old-fashioned backups of folders)

1. in myproject folder,  (not in your actual project but the parent folder) 
do rightclick->git create repository here
it makes a .git folder. This is used to store git stuff and is not useful
to look at. So far nothing has been added to git.
2. in food folder (where the project is) rightClick->tortoisegit->add
Then choose files to add. It shows all files checked, so leave it alone
and click commit.

It then shows the commit dialog; it shows you the files to be committed and wants
you to put in a message (something describing what you've done or need to fix).
It wont commit without a message, so you can put in a single letter.
After commit, it offers to push the new versions to github. If you dont have
github setup or dont want to send files there, just click close.
For now, we are only using git locally, not on the github website.

Git is now setup, now see how its useful.
* edit some file and save it.
you will see a red dot next to the file, meaning that git has a different
version of it. 
* Look at the difference: rightclick the file->tortoisegit->diff with previous version.
it shows you the differences.
* now change more than 1 file. Without highlighting a file, righclick in the
folder, ->tortoisegit->diff with previous version. It will show you all files which you
changed, and if you click on any file, it shows you the difference.
* once you have all files the way you want, and you want to send them it git,
rightclick in the folder, "Git commit->master" and it shows you all changed files,
and wants you to add a commit message like a few steps ago. The next dialog is the
same as before, you can click close or push to your github account; just click
close for now.

*** At this point, git is useful for keeping previous versions to your
work which you can compare to and bring back if you need to.
To see old versions, not just the previous version:
rightclick->tortoisegit->Show Log
It will show all checkins with the date and time.
Click on a checkin and it will show all files checked in (lower window of dialog)
DoubleClick on a file and it will show you the differences beween 

**** this is the advanced section. Dont usually need it *******************

****** branches *****
1. create branch
rightclick->tortoisegit->create branch  Enter new branch name
2. connect to branch
rightclick->tortoisegit->switch/checkout
In "switch to" section, leave branch check but click on the pulldown next to
master and select the new branch.
After that, when you do rightclick->Git Commit, it shows the new branch name.
Then if you do rightclick->tortoisegit->push, it pushes to the new branch on
github.

***** merge ****
merge is opposite of branch-- it brings branches back into one.
To get changes from a branch back to master, change current branch to master:
rightclick->tortoisegit->switch/checkout and choose master.
Then, rightclick->tortoisegit->merge and choose the branch you want to
merge back into master. After that master has the changes from the other branch.
This is good when someone else is working on other files and you want to bring 
the changes together.
