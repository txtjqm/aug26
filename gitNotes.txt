to prepare: install git for windows and then after that install tortoisegit.

The project folder. food is your project folder with source code.
It may or may not look like this, with backups.
myproject
    |-- food
    |-- food-copy
    |-- food-copy2

1. in myproject folder, do rightclick->git create repository here
it makes a .git folder. This is used to store git stuff and is not useful
to look at. So far nothing has been added to git.
2. in food folder (where the project is) rightClick->tortoisegit->add
Then choose files to add. It shows all files checked, so leave it alone
and click commit.
It then shows the commit dialog; it shows you the files to be committed and wants
you to put in a message (something describing what you've done or need to fix).
I usually put in just a 1 or 2 etc. It wont commit without a message.
After commit, it offers to push the new versions to github. If you dont have
github setup or dont want to send files there, just click close.
For now, we are only using git locally, not on the github website.
