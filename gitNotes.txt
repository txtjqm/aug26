to prepare: install git for windows and then after that install tortoisegit.

The project folder. food is your project folder with source code.
It may or may not look like this, with backups.
myproject

    |-- food-copy
    |-- food-copy2

1. in myproject folder, do rightclick->git create repository here
it makes a .git folder. This is used to store git stuff and is not useful
to look at. So far nothing has been added to git.
2. in food folder (where the project is) rightClick->tortoisegit->add
Then choose files to add. It shows all files checked, so leave it along and click ok.
It shows a new dialog- click ok. 

The push command is to send files to the github website,
but we're not at that point yet. We are only using git locally, not on the github website.
