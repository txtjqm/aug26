  vi cars.txt 
  ... now cars.txt has changes but there are also changes on github
      that have not been pull'ed to pc
  git add .
  git commit -m "bbbbzqqq"
  git push -u origin master
  .... get message " ! [rejected]        master -> master (fetch first)"
       and some useless recommendations
  git status
  ...  above shows what the problem is
  git add cars.txt
  git commit -m www
  git push -u origin master
  cat cars.txt 
  ...  this shows the modified cars.txt with differences to it can
       be manually merged
