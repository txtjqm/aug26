  vi cars.txt 
  ... now cars.txt has changes but there are also changes on github
      that have not been pull'ed to pc
  git add .
  git commit -m "bbbbzqqq"
  git push -u origin master
  .... get message " ! [rejected]        master -> master (fetch first)"
       and some useless recommendations
  git status
  ...  above shows what the problem is
  git pull
  ... this inserts git compare notaions into cars.txt
      ie: <<<<<<< HEAD
	another on pc
	=======
	another on github
	>>>>>>> ee2c176caaf77a301ce256aa02ed051b0cae9e12
  vi cars.txt 
  ... use above notations to manually do the merge
