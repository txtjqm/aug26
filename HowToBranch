 git branch -v
 git branch june2_22
 # branch is now made. Now set my current git to the new branch.
 git checkout june2_22
 # git "origin" is name for remote repository project was cloned from
 # you're downstream when you copy (clone, checkout, etc) from a repository
 # now I changed stuff and want to push. 
 # set branch "june2_22" to have its upstream set to branch "origin" 
 # you need to exactly as below so "git pull" will work properly
 git push --set-upstream origin june2_22
 # now gitpush can be done without the upstream stuff
 gitpush
 # try edit something on github console, but make sure its on branch june2...
 git pull
 # now you see above edit.
 # now that you like branch june2.. push it back to master (aka main) branch
